## Group exercise

4 People / group


## Objectives

- Learn more CSS properties
- Learn to apply HTML & CSS in a professional way
- Learn to design from scratch (without us giving examples!)


## Instructions 

- Invent a company together and think of four pages that the company needs.
- Divide those pages amongst the group and each design one page.
- Once you are all finished, join those pages together into one page (page below page)
- Publish the result with a github repository (call it `name-of-your-business`)
- Make sure everyone in the group has a repository of the website
- Explain your company in the readme of the repo and put a link to the company 'website' in there
- Add a parallax image header [Example](https://demo.athemes.com/themes/?theme=Sydney)
- Add google maps pinned on the location of your company somewhere on the onepager
- Try to make your website responsive (if you haven't already)
- Mention your phone number somewhere on the onepager, if you click it should (try to) call you

## Assessment

Each group will evaluate another group. You have a checklist you can go trough. On top of that you are allowed to give your own feedback. Also share it with the group.
The best way to do that is to change this file (you can do so directly on github or fork this repo) and then notify the group in ryver that you added a requirement. 
Add your requirements at the bottom under the learner added requirements title.
Every group should add at least one requirement. The filled out checklist should be added to this repo in this folder.
Give the file a good name.
