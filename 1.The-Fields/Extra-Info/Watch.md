# Tips

## Practice
* Practice the beamer at least once
* Practice what you are going to say at least once, preferably with someone listening

## Slides/other media
* Use the pointer device so you can advance slides without being at your laptop
* Or have someone else do the slides
* DO NOT USE THE LAPTOP YOURSELF, it makes your presentation 10x worse if you do it yourself because you will be talking down, won't be heard as well, you'll strugle doing things cause of the stress, ... 
* So do yourself a favor and ask someone else to handle the switching, playing, slides, ...

## Ask questions
* As introduction to new things: 'what do you know about X?'
* To keep people interested: 'but why would they do X like this?'
* To know if they are getting what you are saying: 'Which of these is correct?'
* Write down those questions and think of the possible responses
  - What if the audience doesnâ€™t know what to answer? Guide them or drop it?

## Content
* Make a long presentation, then cut stuff that is bad/boring
