## Important notice

From here on out all exercises need a basic setup which we will no longer document in the exercise descriptions.
This is what you need:

- A repository
- A well documented readme for the repository
- The final version published and the link to it in the readme as well
- A workable layout on your HTML page
- No errors in the console (in the final code)
- Well documented commits (AND more than two!)
