# DOM Manipulation

## What is DOM Manipulation

The DOM is basically your HTML code, it stands for the structure that HTML gives to you page.
Speaking to your DOM is like selecting that H1 tag.


## Why do we start with this ? 

Javascript (in the olden days) was used generally for two major things:
- DOM Manipulation
- AJAX

These days it can run server-side and do much more. But for now, let's ignore that.
We'll start with looking at DOM Manipulation since this is an easier stepping stone then diving head first into AJAX.


## What is the use of this ?

Well, anytime you see an element do anything that isn't possible with CSS, then you can bet it's done by Javascript.
From insane [animations](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) to .. well... basically [anything](https://plainjs.com/javascript/plugins/).

It's difficult to explain or sum up what you can do with this. Easier would be to show you some examples and let you discover for yourself!
